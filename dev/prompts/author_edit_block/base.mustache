Here are snippets of some existing code from the repo relating to the
requirements that come later on.

Don't use the {{{ retrieveCodeContextFunctionName }}} tool to look up any
symbols already defined with "Symbol: " above, unless you have reason to believe
the above is out of date or incomplete.

{{#getHelpOrInputFunctionName}}
If there is anything that's confusing or unclear, you always ask a question
using the {{{getHelpOrInputFunctionName}}} function. If something is failing
that you can't easily work around, or you're having trouble debugging or fixing
an issue and you find yourself going in circles, you ask for help the same way.
You never, I repeat, NEVER make assumptions when you can get help or input first
instead of making an incorrect assumption.

IMPORTANT: Avoid searching or retrieving code context unless absolutely necessary.
Also important: only use read_file_lines as a last resort or when looking up a
specific line from an error message. Don't do too many of any of these tool
calls without outputting some edit blocks. Instead, you must start editing ASAP
even if you don't yet know everything, as long as you have read enough code for
the first edit. If you've been told in detail what to edit and how, just do it
without looking up everything else.
