An *edit block* is formatted like so:

- Use 2 newlines before the first line of the edit block.
- The first line is "~~~~" (without quotes), optionally followed by the
  language name, as in regular code blocks.
- The second line is "edit_block:" followed by the edit block sequence number,
  which must start at 1 and be auto-incremented for each edit block.
- The third line is the path to the file
- The fourth line is "{{{search}}}" (without quotes) when updating an existing
  file, "<<<<<<< CREATE_FILE" when creating a file, "<<<<<<< DELETE_FILE" when
  creating a file and "<<<<<<< APPEND_TO_FILE" when appending to an existing
  file.
- The next lines (the OLD LINES section) are the old lines of text that need to be
  replaced or provide context, if any. Only provide old lines that are present
  in your code context, and ensure they are copied verbatim
- Then comes a line with "{{{divider}}}" (without quotes)
- The next lines are the updated text that replace the old lines
- The second-last line is "{{{replace}}}" (without quotes) when searching.
  When creating or appending to file, instead of "REPLACE_EXACT" it should be "NEW_LINES"
- The last line is "~~~~" (without quotes)

We use the above format for each *edit block*. Do not place multiple conflict
markers within a single *edit block*. Above the OLD LINES section, write the path
to the file. In the OLD LINES section, write out the old code (which must be
present in the chat history context) being replaced verbatim, and in the NEW
LINES section, write out the new code, also verbatim, as it should appear in the
final file. Here's an example of an *edit block*, adding a new method named
another_method above an existing method:

~~~~python
edit_block:1
foo/bar/something.py
{{{search}}}
	def existing_method(x):
{{{divider}}}
	def another_method(a):
		print(a)
		return a

	def existing_method(x):
{{{replace}}}
~~~~

Here's another example, redefining the method added above:

~~~~python
edit_block:2
foo/bar/something.py
{{{search}}}
	def another_method(a):
		print(a)
		return a
{{{divider}}}
	def another_method(a, b):
		print(a)
		print(b)
		return a + b
{{{replace}}}
~~~~

An example adding a new class above an existing one:

~~~~python
edit_block:3
foo/bar/something.py
{{{search}}}
class SomeExistingClass():
{{{divider}}}
class TheNewClass():
	pass

class SomeExistingClass():
{{{replace}}}
~~~~

Notice we add last lines in the search section as the last lines in the replace
section, to ensure we don't break the existing class.

Anther example, this time adding a new method to the top of an existing class:

~~~~python
edit_block:4
foo/bar/something.py
{{{search}}}
class SomeExistingClass():
{{{divider}}}
class SomeExistingClass():
	def the_new_method():
		pass
{{{replace}}}
~~~~

Every edit block must be fenced with '~~~~'. The first
line after the fencing should be the file name, followed directly by the
conflict markers.

Very important: all lines in the OLD LINES section must match the original code
exactly, being an exact set of sequential lines from the file, including
comments. NEVER try to edit functions without reading their full body.
To create new files, provide a new file path, use "CREATE_FILE" instead of
"SEARCH_EXACT" and 0 lines in the OLD LINES section. For example, the following edit
block creates the file at path "foo/bar/newfile.json":

~~~~json
edit_block:5
foo/bar/newfile.json
<<<<<<< CREATE_FILE
{{{divider}}}
{"key": "value"}
>>>>>>> NEW_LINES
~~~~

To append at the end (emphasis: THE END), of an existing file, use
"APPEND_TO_FILE" instead of "CREATE_FILE" and 0 lines in the OLD LINES section.
Then the new lines will be appended to the end of the existing file. This is
suitable only when adding new top-level code, since nested code, eg test cases,
will be invalid if just appended to the end of a file. This will never add to
the beginning of a file. Creating a file that already exists will fail, as will
appending to a file that does not exist.

Remember these rules:

1. NEVER SKIP LINES OR COMMENTS in the OLD LINES section!
2. NEVER ELIDE LINES AND REPLACE THEM WITH A COMMENT!
3. NEVER OMIT OR CHANGE ANY WHITESPACE (tabs or spaces stay the same)!
4. ALWAYS INCLUDE THE PATH TO THE FILE AT THE START OF AN EDIT BLOCK!
5. Retain existing comments including TODOs/FIXMEs, unless they are resolved
6. Start a OLD LINES section with a line that is just a 4-6 lines before the first
line where a change is required
7. Do NOT add comments explaining the changes made to a specific line of code.
Only include comments that would help someone else understand the code on its
own and not in relation to the change being made.
8. Increment the edit block sequence number for each new edit block, so that we
have a unique number for each edit block.
9. Ensure you edit balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces across old and new
lines correctly. If the old line does not have a closing brace, the new line
should not have a closing brace either.
10. Don't include imports when using APPEND_TO_FILE when there are already
imports at the top of the file: edit those import lines to add the new imports
instead.
11. Edit a single symbol (function/type/etc) at a time per edit block. For
multiple edits to multiple symbols, use multiple separate edit blocks, each
closed via the last line "~~~~". Do this even if the symbols are beside each
other in the same file.
12. Never try to edit any lines of code that you don't see. Instead, use tools
to view all the lines of code you want to edit first if the lines you want to
edit are not visible to you.
13. Never add useless comments. Don't explain what you are changing in comments
in the edit block new lines. Comments saying what was "// Added" or "// Removed"
or otherwise just detailing the obvious are absolutely not welcome. Comments
must ALWAYS make sense outside of the context of a specific edit and task. It's
fine to add such comments if thinking out loud, not within an edit block, but
then remove these extraneous & unnecessary comments for the final formatted edit
blocks.
14. ALWAYS include two newlines (i.e. \n\n) before each edit block.

{{#applyEditBlocksImmediately}}
Edit blocks are applied immediately after each response. You will receive
feedback about whether each edit block was applied successfully or failed.
{{/applyEditBlocksImmediately}}
{{^applyEditBlocksImmediately}}
When you are done with all edit blocks, avoid using further tools: output
without a tool call is the signal for us to finally apply those edits to the
filesystem. Edit blocks from all messages that include tool calls will remain
pending until that point.
