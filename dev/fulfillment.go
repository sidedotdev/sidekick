You are determining if the work done during a specific step of a plan was
completed successfully and fulfills the criteria set for that step.

Thinking step-by-step as a senior software engineer, analyze the following git
diff and determine if the step has been completed correctly and its completion
criteria fulfilled. First output your analysis of the diff against all aspects
of the criteria. In addition, analyze whether the code changes look correct and
maintain previous functionality that should not have been altered as part of the
change (taking into account the latest test results).

Review the latest code changes for any issues. If there are major issues, we
consider that an unsaid criterium for correctness that has not been fulfilled.
If you're not sure if it's an issue or its something you cannot check for (eg
whether an import already existed), assume it is correct unless test results
tell you otherwise. If there are code changes referenced that we got user
feedback on, then only consider the latest user feedback and the latest code,
not the earlier code/requirements.

Finally, output whether the step is complete and criteria are fulfilled or not.
The "is_fulfilled" field should be set to true if and only if the step is
complete and criteria are completely fulfilled. Do not say that the criteria is
not fulfilled if a later step in the plan is clearly intended to fix the issue.

Here is a reminder of the original requirements, the plan execution context,
the current step and completion criteria:

# START REQUIREMENTS
%s
# END REQUIREMENTS

# START PLAN
%s
# END PLAN

# START CURRENT STEP
%s
# END CURRENT STEP

# START Completion Criteria
%s
# END Completion Criteria

And here is the latest git diff:

%s

And coming up are results of automated checks, which is important for your
analysis. A failure here is not automatically a failure of the criteria -- that
depends on your analysis, since failure may be expected or even desired -- but
it is a strong hint that something might be wrong with the work done. If you
notice that the step is defined in a way that necessarily fails the checks
temporarily, and the manner in which it failed matches what should be expected,
and you also confirm first that there is already a later step defined that is
expected to fix the issue, then this kind of failure doesn't mean the criteria
haven't been fulfilled.

If there is no such later step or the step doesn't necessitate the failure, then
consider the criteria NOT fulfilled. Even if the failure doesn't seem directly
related to the step, if it's not expected nor is there an expected later step
that will fix it, consider the criteria not fulfilled, so you must analyze the
failure and determine if pre-planned steps exist that will fix it. Don't think
about what is "likely" to happen in future steps. Instead, start by spelling out
the specific future step from the above plan that you think will fix the issue
if you think the automatic check failure is not meant to be fixed in the current
step. If there's no such step, consider the criteria not fulfilled due to the
failure.

If the automated tests clearly indicate a failure related to the changes made in
the current step or a previous one without a followup step explicitly defined to
fix it, then don't analyze too much after determining that fact: just indicate
that the tests should be fixed. When they are fixed, we'll come back to analyze
whether criteria is fulfilled fully later.

Anyways, here are the automated check results:
