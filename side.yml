mission: |
  Sidekick is a human-in-the-loop system designed to support software developers
  through GenAI automation. Sidekick should be easy for developers to set up and
  use, intuitive to understand and highly introspectable with realtime feedback
  and granular tracking. It should be able to be guided by developers using it,
  but do as much as can be done reliably without the human in the loop, before
  engaging them. The core mission of Sidekick is to make developers more
  productive as they work within large existing code bases.
